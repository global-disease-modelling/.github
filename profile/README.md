# Global Disease Modelling at The Kids


Hello! We are the Global Disease Modelling team at [The Kids Research
Institute Australia](https://www.thekids.org.au/our-research/early-environment/infection-and-vaccines/intervention-and-infectious-disease-modelling/) 
led by [Professor Melissa Penny](https://www.thekids.org.au/contact-us/our-people/p/melissa-penny/), [Fiona Stanley Chair of Child Health Research](https://www.uwa.edu.au/news/article/2023/february/leading-disease-modeller-appointed-inaugural-fiona-stanley-chair-of-child-health-research).

We aim to understand how pathogen, host and intervention dynamics
combine to prevent disease progression and transmission and to address
contemporary issues in infectious diseases and global health.
