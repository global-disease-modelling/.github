# Global Disease Modelling at The Kids


Hello! We are the Global Disease Modelling team at The Kids Research
Institute Australia led by Professor Melissa Penny.

We aim to understand how pathogen, host and intervention dynamics
combine to prevent disease progression and transmission and to address
contemporary issues in infectious diseases and global health.
